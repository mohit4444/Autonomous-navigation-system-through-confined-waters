<h3>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repository with <b><i>git clone https://github.com/mohit4444/Autonomous-navigation-system-through-confined-waters.git</i> </b></li>
<li>Change the working directory with <b><i>cd Autonomous-navigation-system-through-confined-waters</b></i></li>
<li>There are several methods to run index.html file on localhost. Here are a few:</li>
<ul>
<li>1. Using a Simple HTTP Server with Python:
   If you have Python installed on your computer, you can use its built-in HTTP server.

For Python 3.x:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing index.html file.
Run the command: python -m http.server
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. </li>

For Python 2.x:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing index.html file.
Run the command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

<li>2. Using Node.js with http-server:
   If you have Node.js and npm installed:

Install http-server globally with: npm install -g http-server
Navigate to the directory containing index.html file in the terminal or command prompt.
Run the command: http-server
Open your web browser and go to the address provided, usually http://localhost:8080. </li>

<li>3. Using Visual Studio Code with "Live Server" Extension:
   If you use Visual Studio Code as your code editor:

Install the "Live Server" extension from the VS Code marketplace.
Open the project code in VS Code.
Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".
Your default browser will automatically open and display the index.html file. </li>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>üí° Tips</h3>
When the simulation starts running, it might be zoomed in. For optimal performance and a smoother simulation experience, please ensure the entire simulation is visible in your browser window by zooming out until the full view is achieved.

The simulation is designed with a unique feature to ensure only the best-performing boats contribute to future generations. On rare occasions, if the initial fleet of boats doesn't meet our high standards of performance (they cover very little distance in the first generation), the simulation will pause, causing the boats to disappear. This is our system's way of filtering out underperforming boats right from the start so that they don't reproduce. If this happens, simply refresh the page. This will reinitialise the simulation, granting the boats another opportunity to excel in the first generation. Consider it our way of ensuring quality right from the get-go!
